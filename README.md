### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://hasni.co/portfolio/sneakers)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Context API (for State Management)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I did

Eventhough it looks any other static webpage. However I have built this page with concept of "Reusable components" which is the fundamental of React JS. This is a standalone webpage that takes "Product Data" & then output a JSON Object that can be used by API as a POST request from the App.
The product data is can be accessed from API with variables including Title, Description, Price, Discount, Images etc.

### Continued development

This simple looking App has many functionalities that has to be developed. However I was able to achieve this without much difficulty. However I would like to work more on Animation part & would like to add creative Animations to make the App more Interactive.
